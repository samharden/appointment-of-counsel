<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why is avoiding a DUI conviction so important?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DUI convictions carry stiff penalties, and they can have lasting economic consequences on both insurance and employment. If you are convicted of a DUI, your car insurance rates will increase and can add up to thousands of dollars over time.</p>
